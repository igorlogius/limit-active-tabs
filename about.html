<b>Why should i use this and not "Auto Tab Discard"? </b>
This addon is more lightweight and far easier to use (configure), since has only
a few options.
<b>Usage/Features:</b>
<ol>
  <li>
    change the max number of active tabs (default is 3) in the preferences
  </li>
  <li>
    change if pinned tabs should be included when considering unloading tabs
  </li>
  <li>
    use the toolbar button to exclude the current or all highlighted tabs from
    unloading
  </li>
</ol>
