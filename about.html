Limits the number of active tabs, by unloading older tabs (determined by last tab activation) 

<b>Why should i use this and not "Auto Tab Discard"? </b>
This addon is more lightweight and far easier to use (configure), since it only has 1 option (the amount of tabs to keep loaded)  
So all in all for people who like their addons simple, small and to the point. 

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
	<li>install the add-on </li>
		  <li>(optional) on the addons preference page change the max number of active tabs (default is 3)</li>
</ol>
